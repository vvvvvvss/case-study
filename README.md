# Project: Customer Churn Prediction for a Subscription-based Service

**Objective:**
The objective of this project is to develop a predictive model to identify customers who are at risk of churning (canceling their subscription) for a subscription-based service, such as a streaming platform, telecommunications provider, or software-as-a-service (SaaS) product. By proactively identifying at-risk customers, the company can take targeted retention actions to reduce churn and improve customer lifetime value.

**Machine Learning Algorithms and Mathematical Constructs Used:**

1. **Classification Models:**
   - *Logistic Regression:* Logistic regression can be used as a baseline model to predict the probability of customer churn based on various features such as demographic information, usage patterns, and engagement metrics.
   - *Random Forest Classifier:* Random forests can capture non-linear relationships between features and churn, making them effective for identifying complex patterns in customer behavior.
   - *Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM):* GBM algorithms like XGBoost or LightGBM can handle large datasets with high dimensionality and are robust to outliers, making them suitable for churn prediction tasks.

2. **Feature Engineering:**
   - *Recency, Frequency, Monetary (RFM) Analysis:* RFM analysis can be used to create features that quantify the recency, frequency, and monetary value of each customer's interactions with the service. These features can provide valuable insights into customer behavior and preferences.
   - *User Engagement Metrics:* Features such as login frequency, session duration, and interaction with key features of the service can help capture user engagement levels, which are strong indicators of churn risk.
   - *Customer Lifetime Value (CLV):* CLV metrics can be calculated using historical transaction data to estimate the expected revenue contribution from each customer over their lifetime. High CLV customers may be prioritized for retention efforts.

3. **Imbalanced Data Handling:**
   - *Sampling Techniques:* Since churn events are typically rare compared to non-churn events, techniques such as oversampling (e.g., Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique, SMOTE) or undersampling can be used to balance the dataset and prevent model bias towards the majority class.
   - *Cost-sensitive Learning:* Adjusting class weights or using cost-sensitive learning algorithms can penalize misclassification of the minority class (churn) more heavily, improving the model's ability to identify at-risk customers.

4. **Model Interpretability:**
   - *Feature Importance Analysis:* Techniques such as permutation feature importance or SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values can be used to interpret the contribution of individual features to the model's predictions, providing insights into the factors driving churn.

**Documentation:**
The documentation for this project would cover similar sections as before, tailored to the specific context of customer churn prediction:
- Problem Statement and Business Context: Explanation of the importance of churn prediction for the company and its potential impact on revenue and customer satisfaction.
- Data Collection and Preprocessing: Details of the data sources, data cleaning procedures, and feature engineering techniques applied to prepare the dataset for modeling.
- Model Selection and Training: Description of the machine learning algorithms chosen, hyperparameter tuning process, and evaluation metrics used to assess model performance.
- Model Interpretation and Deployment: Insights gained from feature importance analysis and recommendations for deploying the churn prediction model in production, including integration with existing customer management systems and workflows.

This documentation would serve as a valuable resource for business stakeholders, data scientists, and marketing teams involved in customer retention efforts.
